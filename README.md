# üí´ About Me:
My name is Danila Vasilev and I am a backend software engineer from Saint-Petersburg, Russia.<br><br>I was interested in programming ever since I was 15 and then I started taking courses in computer science. Unlike many of my schoolmates I came up with an idea of my future career very early, after combining what I am really interested in and what I can really do I developed a desire to become a software engineer.<br><br>Since then all steps in my life were binded with that idea, I have entered University and successfully graduated with a bachelor‚Äôs degree in computer science. During my education I have entered a couple of internships which gave me a deeper understanding in what I am going to do in my future job.<br><br>In graduation year I was offered and took a part-time job of an associate software engineer which after my graduation became my full-time job.<br><br>I continue to work @genesysengage as a software engineer
